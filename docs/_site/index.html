<p>NHRI Hub offers modern data and document management tools for the small National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) where internal IT infrastructure may not be available.</p>

<p>NHRI Hub is a web-based application, secured by two-factor authentication tokens, that permits staff to share documents and files, with reliable automatic backup.</p>

<p>Automatically generated reminders help to ensure timely and consistent follow-up on all tasks.</p>

<p>Since the source code of NHRI Hub is open-source, it can be tailored or enhanced to meet the particular needs of your specific NHRI organization. It has been designed to facilitate internationalization, translation into languages other than English has been anticipated in the structure of the files, and dynamic language switching is even possible.</p>

<h2 id="complaints-log">Complaints Log</h2>
<p>Human rights complaints may be logged directly into a database, at the time that the complainaint presents the complaint. A paper copy may then be printed for the complainant and for complainant and witness signature endorsements.</p>

<p>As a complaint proceeds from being opened to its resolution, all communications, whether by phone, email or letter, may be recorded with the complaint, so that a complete record of communications is always available to staff within the NHRI.</p>

<p>Future reminders may be set, to prompt followup on communications and commitments. Reminders are sent automatically by email.</p>

<p>The overall list of open complaints may be reviewed, as a printed list if required, as a management tool to monitor the organization’s work load and progress, and also to understand the reporting rate.</p>

<p>For further insight into a country’s human rights progress in different areas, complaints are indexed by the area to which they pertain.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-get-the-software">How to get the software</h1>

<p>The software may be browsed in its open-source repository <a href="" id="view-on-github">here.</a></p>

<p>You can download the software <a href="" id="download-zip">as a .zip file</a> or <a href="" id="download-tar-gz">as a .tar.gz file</a>.</p>

<h1 id="what-will-it-cost">What will it cost?</h1>
<p>Whilst the software itself is offered at no charge, it will need to be hosted by a web host service. For the NHRI Hub application, the cost of hosting is mainly dependant on the amount of data that you will be storing. It is likely to be in the order of a few hundred dollars (US) per year, but this is a rough estimate, and we cannot be more precise without knowing details of your usage.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-get-more-information">How to get more information</h1>
<p>Development assistance is available at no cost to tailor the software to the particular needs of your NHRI.</p>

<p>Let us know of your interest and we will contact you and answer your questions. If the application seems like a good match for your needs we can work on any customization that you might need, or we can deploy the application as it is.</p>
