# Description

NHRI Hub offers modern data and document management tools for the small National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) where internal IT infrastructure may not be available.

NHRI Hub is a web-based application, secured by two-factor authentication tokens, that permits staff to share documents and files, with reliable automatic backup.

Automatically generated reminders help to ensure timely and consistent follow-up on all tasks.

Since the source code of NHRI Hub is open-source, it can be tailored or enhanced to meet the particular needs of your specific NHRI organization. It has been designed to facilitate internationalization, translation into languages other than English has been anticipated in the structure of the files, and dynamic language switching is even possible.

# Modules
## Complaints Log
Human rights complaints may be logged directly into a database, at the time that the complainaint presents the complaint. A paper copy may then be printed for complainant and witness signature endorsements, and for the complainant's personal files.

As a complaint proceeds from being opened to its resolution, all communications, whether by phone, email or letter, may be recorded with the complaint, so that a complete record of communications is always available to staff within the NHRI.

Future reminders may be set, to prompt followup on communications and commitments, notify participants in a future meeting, or simply as an *aide memoire* for personal tasks. Reminders are sent automatically by email.

The overall list of open complaints may be reviewed, as a printed list if required, as a management tool to monitor the organization's work load and progress, and also to understand the reporting rate.

For further insight into a country's human rights progress in different areas, complaints are indexed by the area to which they pertain.
## Strategic Plan
A template is provided in which to design a strategic plan for the organization which is logically composed of strategic priorities, expected planned results, actual outcomes and activities. Performance indicators and their target criteria may be associated with activities so that change may be measured over time. Finally media appearances and internal projects may be linked to performance indicators as a way to record possible effectors.
## Project Documentation and Tracking
Projects are any activity that the NHRI undertakes to further community outreach as part of the strategic objectives of the organization.
## Document Management
A document management module is included, in which documents may be stored in a database so that they are accessible to all staff members. Previous versions of documents may also be stored together with their most recent version.
## Advisory Council Management
### Terms of Reference
The current terms of reference document for the advisory council, as well as any previous revision of that document, are stored in the database, so that it is readily accessible to all staff.
### Membership
The membership roster of the advisory council is recorded, with contact information.
### Meeting Minutes
Advisory council meeting minutes may be stored in the database, and reminders may be linked to these, so that consistent followup can be facilitated.
### Issues
Human rights issues that are brought to the attention of the advisory council may be logged, with notes attached and reminders linked. If desired, a printed list may be generated, for example to be reviewed at advisory council meetings.
## Human Rights Indicators
The human rights indicators module is based on the UN Document [Human Rights Indicators: A guide to implementation and measurement](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Human_rights_indicators_en.pdf). It provides a structured and methodical approach to selecting and monitoring indicators of human rights. Refer to the UN document for details.
## GANHRI Accreditation Document Repository
GANHRI (formerly ICC) requires certain specific documents to be produced as part of the NHRI accreditation procedure. This module manages those documentsin the same way as internal documents (above) but also identifies them separately, as they have specific titles and specific external significance.
## Media Appearance Logging
Maintaining a record of media articles related to the NHRI's human rights activities, or to general or specific human rights discussions in the country can develop a valuable resource for the NHRI to use in research, reporting, and effectiveness assessment. The media appearance module serves as a repository for such articles to be stored and categorized for later retrieval.
# How to get the software

The software may be browsed in its open-source repository <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}" id="view-on-github" >here.</a>

You can download the software <a href="{{ site.github.zip_url }}" id="download-zip" >as a .zip file</a> or <a href="{{ site.github.tar_url }}" id="download-tar-gz">as a .tar.gz file</a>.

# What will it cost?
Whilst the software itself is offered at no charge, it will need to be hosted by a web hosting service. For the NHRI Hub application, the cost of hosting is mainly dependant on the amount of data that you will be storing. It is likely to be in the order of a few hundred dollars (US) per year, but this is a rough estimate, and we cannot be more precise without knowing details of your usage.
# How to get more information
Development assistance is available at no cost to tailor the software to the particular needs of your NHRI.

Let us know of your interest and we will contact you and answer your questions. If the application seems like a good match for your needs we can work on any customization that you might need, or we can work with you deploy the application as it is.
